## About TALL News

TALL News is a project made using TALL Stack (TailwindCSS, AlpineJS, Laravel and Livewire).

It uses NewsAPI as the background service to provide real-time and updated news from Brazil.
The front-end design is basically from G1, a news portal from Brazil too.

The project's objective is to show how easy is to build complex applications with TALL Stack. 
I mean, fetching APIs, using loading states and async requests is painful with some languages/techs).

## Concepts/Practices
- Blade Components
- Cache API responses
- PHP's 8.0 constructor property promotion (I personally love this one)

This was made in 4 hours.
